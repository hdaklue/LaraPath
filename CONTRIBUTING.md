- Use descriptive test method names that explain the behavior being tested
- Group related tests in the same test class

### Documentation
- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add examples for new functionality
- Keep docblocks up to date
- Comment complex logic

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass: `composer test`

4. Update documentation if necessary
5. Create a pull request with a clear description of changes
6. Link to any relevant issues
